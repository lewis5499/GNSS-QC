# GNSS_QC: for GPS(L1/L2/L5) and BDS(B1/B2/B3)

This is a software for GNSS positioning result analysis and accuracy evaluation based on matlab.

The software implements the following functions : 
satellite(system) intergrity rate of observations detection, signal-to-noise ratio analysis, 
carrier phase cycle slip and gross error detection, and pseudo-range multipath effects on positioning accuracy.

The visualization results of all the above functions are stored in the corresponding directory of the 'img' folder,
and the images are named as the detailed information of the corresponding visualization objects.

See the report(.pdf) for more details.
